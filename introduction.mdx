# Introduction to AgentGate

AgentGate is a B2B platform that enables software companies to add verified AI code automation to their products. Submit work orders describing what you want accomplished, and AgentGate executes the task with built-in verification to ensure quality.

## What AgentGate Does

AgentGate handles the complexity of AI-powered code automation so you don't have to:

- **Execute Work Orders**: Submit tasks describing what you want accomplished in a codebase
- **Iterate Automatically**: AI generates code, runs verification, and improves until requirements are met
- **Verify Quality**: Multi-level verification ensures generated code meets quality standards
- **Deliver Results**: Get pull requests, diffs, or direct results back to your application

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit a Work Order">
    Send a work order via API describing what you want accomplished. Include the task prompt and workspace source (GitHub repo, template, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="AgentGate Executes">
    AgentGate creates an isolated workspace, runs the AI agent, generates code, and verifies the results through multiple verification levels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Results">
    Get notified via webhook when complete. Retrieve the results including any pull requests created, changes made, and verification status.
  </Step>
</Steps>
