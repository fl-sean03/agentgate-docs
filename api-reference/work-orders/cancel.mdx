    "message": "Work order canceled successfully",
    "wasRunning": true

}
```

### Already Completed

Returns 409 Conflict if the work order is already in a terminal state.

```json

  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "CONFLICT",
    "message": "Cannot cancel work order in status 'succeeded'"
  },
  "requestId": "req_xyz789"
}
```

## Behavior

| Original Status | Behavior |
|-----------------|----------|
| `queued` | Immediately marked as canceled |
| `running` | Graceful shutdown initiated, then marked canceled |
| `succeeded` | Returns 409 Conflict |
| `failed` | Returns 409 Conflict |
| `canceled` | Returns 409 Conflict |

<Tip>
  For running work orders, the agent process is given time to clean up before the work order is marked as canceled. Use the [Force Kill](/api-reference/work-orders/kill) endpoint if you need immediate termination.
