## Status Requirements

| Work Order Status | Can Start Run? |
|-------------------|----------------|
| `queued` | ✅ Yes |
| `failed` | ✅ Yes (retry) |
| `running` | ❌ No |
| `succeeded` | ❌ No |
| `canceled` | ❌ No |

## Use Cases

### Retry a Failed Work Order

```bash
# Check work order status
curl https://agentgate.mynewapi.com/api/v1/work-orders/wo_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# If failed, start a new run
curl -X POST https://agentgate.mynewapi.com/api/v1/work-orders/wo_abc123/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Monitor the New Run

After starting a run, you can monitor its progress:

```bash
# Get run details
curl https://agentgate.mynewapi.com/api/v1/runs/run_xyz789 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Or get work order details (includes all runs)
curl https://agentgate.mynewapi.com/api/v1/work-orders/wo_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Run Lifecycle

When you start a run:

1. **Request received** - Run ID is generated
2. **Status: queued** - Run is queued for execution
3. **Status: building** - Workspace is being prepared
4. **Status: running** - Agent is executing
5. **Status: succeeded/failed** - Run completes

The response returns immediately with the run ID. The run executes asynchronously.

<Tip>
  Use [WebSocket streaming](/api-reference/overview#websocket) or polling to monitor run progress in real-time.
