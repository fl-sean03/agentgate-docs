# Quickstart

Get up and running with AgentGate in 15 minutes. By the end of this guide, you'll have submitted your first work order and retrieved the results.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- An AgentGate account with an organization
- An organization API key
- A GitHub repository or codebase to work with

<Info>
  Don't have an account? [Sign up](https://agentgate.mynewapi.com/signup) to get started.
</Info>

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. Log in to your [AgentGate Dashboard](https://agentgate.mynewapi.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give your key a name (e.g., "Development")
5. Select the scopes you need (or use wildcard for full access)
6. Copy and save your API key securely

<Warning>
  Your API key is only shown once. Store it securely and never commit it to source control.
</Warning>

API keys follow the format `org_live_` followed by a random string.

## Step 2: Make Your First API Call

Let's submit a simple work order. This example asks AgentGate to add a README file to a repository.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.agentgate.mynewapi.com/v1/work-orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "taskPrompt": "Create a README.md file that describes this project based on the code structure",
    "workspaceSource": {
      "type": "git",
      "repository": "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo",
      "branch": "main"
    }
  }'
```

```typescript TypeScript SDK
import { AgentGate } from '@agentgate/sdk';

const client = new AgentGate({
  apiKey: process.env.AGENTGATE_API_KEY
});

const workOrder = await client.workOrders.create({
  taskPrompt: "Create a README.md file that describes this project based on the code structure",
  workspaceSource: {
    type: "git",
    repository: "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo",
    branch: "main"
  }
});

console.log('Work Order ID:', workOrder.workOrderId);
console.log('Run ID:', workOrder.runId);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.agentgate.mynewapi.com/v1/work-orders",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "taskPrompt": "Create a README.md file that describes this project based on the code structure",
        "workspaceSource": {
            "type": "git",
            "repository": "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo",
            "branch": "main"
        }
    }
)

data = response.json()
print(f"Work Order ID: {data['workOrderId']}")
print(f"Run ID: {data['runId']}")
```

</CodeGroup>

You'll receive a response like:

```json
{
  "workOrderId": "wo_abc123xyz",
  "runId": "run_def456uvw",
  "status": "pending",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Step 3: Check the Result

The run executes asynchronously. Check the status by polling the run endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.agentgate.mynewapi.com/v1/runs/run_def456uvw \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```typescript TypeScript SDK
const run = await client.runs.get('run_def456uvw');

console.log('Status:', run.status);
if (run.status === 'succeeded') {
  console.log('PR URL:', run.prUrl);
}
```

```python Python
response = requests.get(
    f"https://api.agentgate.mynewapi.com/v1/runs/run_def456uvw",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
)

run = response.json()
print(f"Status: {run['status']}")
if run['status'] == 'succeeded':
    print(f"PR URL: {run.get('prUrl')}")
```

</CodeGroup>

Run status values:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Queued for execution |
| `running` | Currently executing |
| `succeeded` | Completed successfully |
| `failed` | Completed with failure |
| `cancelled` | Stopped by user |

<Tip>
  For production integrations, use [webhooks](/b2b/webhooks) instead of polling to receive real-time notifications when runs complete.
</Tip>

## What Just Happened

When you submitted the work order:

1. **AgentGate validated** the request and created a work order
2. **A run was created** to execute the work order
3. **An isolated workspace** was set up from your repository
4. **The AI agent** analyzed the code and generated the README
5. **Verification ran** to ensure the output meets quality standards
6. **A pull request** was created with the changes (if configured)
